But what completely slipped my attention in my review of Momiyama, 1927 were the statements “Collected by Mr. I Furuiti” and, especially, the even more compelling “The subspecific name is given in honour of Mr. I. Furuiti who collected this form for me" incorporated into the paper itself. </i><i>I completely agree with the conclusion that this is sufficient internal evidence to justify the emendation to furuitii in accordance with the Code.</i><br>
